# plat-scanner
Handy tool that scans dropped prime parts when closing a relic and shows their cost from warframe.market, helping you to make a better choice.

Stopping all development on this because I have found [this](https://github.com/WFCD/WFinfo). So there is no reason to continue... Maybe I will finish it on MVP level just to have some interesting project in portfolio sometime in the future.
